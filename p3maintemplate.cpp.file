// You will probably need to add more #include directives.
// Remember: use <angle brackets> for standard C++ headers/libraries
// and "double quotes" for headers in the same directory as this file.
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdio> // for sscanf because Dr. Oster likes the C way to
                  // get data from strings better than the C++ way
using namespace std; // if you want to type out "std::" every time, delete this

/*
   If you want your variables and data structures for the banker's
   algorithm to have global scope, declare them here. This may make
   the rest of your program easier to write. 
   
   Most software engineers say global variables are a Bad Idea (and 
   they're usually correct!), but systems programmers do it all the
   time, so I'm allowing it here.
